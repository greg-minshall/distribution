* distributions -- generate various distributions.

distributions is a simple command line tool that allows you to
generate various 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
usage: ./distribution [-h] [-i ITERATIONS] [-s SEED] DISTRIBUTION PARAMETERS
#+END_EXAMPLE

to see what distributions are available, the parameters (and defaults)
for each disribution:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
% ./distribution -h
Distributions:
        exponential [MEAN (1.0)]
        geometric [PROBABILITY (0.5)]
        normal [MEAN (0.0)] [STDDEV (1.0)
        pareto [LOCATION (1.0)] [SHAPE (1.0)]
        poisson [MEAN (1.0)]
        uniform [LOWER (0) UPPER (1)]
#+END_EXAMPLE

``-s'' allows you to get repeatability by specifying an initial seed.

``-i'' allow you to get that many iterates.
